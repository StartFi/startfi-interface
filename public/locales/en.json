Anything that exists online can be purchased as an NFT, theoretically. An NFT is “a type of cryptographic token,” Emerging Tech Brew writer Ryan Duffy explains, but NFTs are different from cryptocurrencies because they’re not interchangeable. Think of Pokémon cards: You can trade them, but a Gastly is not the same as a holographic Charizard. But a bitcoin is indistinguishable from another bitcoin.",
