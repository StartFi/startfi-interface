  "needHelpA0": "Non-Fungible Tokens are unique, easily verifiable digital assets that can represent items such as GIFs, images, videos, music albums, and more. Anything that exists online can be purchased as an NFT, theoretically. An NFT is “a type of cryptographic token,” Emerging Tech Brew writer Ryan Duffy explains, but NFTs are different from cryptocurrencies because they’re not interchangeable. Think of Pokémon cards: You can trade them, but a Gastly is not the same as a holographic Charizard. But a bitcoin is indistinguishable from another bitcoin.",
  "needHelpA1": "StartFi leverages NFTs to enable content creators to harness their content and fully digitize and manage them the way they wish. Content creators can mint NFTs to represent their content, from there the sky's the limit. The NFTs can be used to sell content to the community using the marketplace. Also, content creators can use StartFi Launchpad to raise funds using NFTs in order to support their content creation activities.",
  "needHelpA2": "StartFi’s marketplace allows users to buy or bed on available NFTs. If the NFT is listed as an auction, the users will be able to place their own bids to buy the NFT. Auctions also have set price to buy an NFT immediately instead of bidding.",
  "needHelpA3": "No. The concept of non-fungible tokens has been around for years. NFTs have been around since 2012, but have become more popular in recent years. Ethereum’s ERC-721 standard is the first NFT standard that became popular in the blockchain community starting in 2018.",
